 * Optimizes simple arithmetic operations involving vector constants with
 * redundant channels. For instance, (v + vec2(f, 0)) will be optimized to
 * vec2(v.x, v.y + f). In an ideal case with a single "active" component, this
 * optimizes the vector operation into an equivalent scalar operation, aiding
 * scheduling on vector backends.
